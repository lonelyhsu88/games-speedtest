ARCADE BINGO GAME - COMPREHENSIVE PERFORMANCE TEST REPORT
=========================================================

Test Date: $(date)
Test Location: Current testing environment (non-Bangladesh)

1. CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND
========================

🔴 MAJOR: Game Bundle Resources Missing (404 Errors)
   - internal/config.d17e2.json: 404 NOT FOUND
   - resources/config.a38a9.json: 404 NOT FOUND
   - These bundles are ESSENTIAL for game initialization
   - Game CANNOT start without these resources
   - Impact: GAME WILL NOT LOAD AT ALL

🔴 MAJOR: Multiple CDN Domains
   - Primary: www.shuangzi6688.com (Akamai CDN - US based)
   - Assets: uts7rai5u7vv0q08.elsgame.cc (Cloudflare)
   - Cross-domain resource loading may cause CORS issues

⚠️  WARNING: No DNS A record for shuangzi6688.com
   - Only www.shuangzi6688.com resolves
   - May cause access issues in some regions


2. RESOURCE LOADING ANALYSIS
=============================

Main Resources:
- HTML page: 7.2 KB
- CSS: 2.5 KB
- settings.js: 318 bytes
- main.js: 10 KB
- cocos2d-js-min.js: 2 MB (compressed to 616 KB via gzip)

Total Initial Load: ~636 KB (compressed)

Loading Sequence Timeline:
1. HTML: ~0.15s
2. CSS + settings.js + main.js: ~0.1s (parallel)
3. Cocos2d framework: 0.5-1.7s (BOTTLENECK)
4. Game bundles: FAIL (404 errors)


3. NETWORK PERFORMANCE METRICS
===============================

shuangzi6688.com (Akamai CDN):
- DNS lookup: 9.8ms
- TCP connect: 25ms
- TLS handshake: 106ms
- Time to first byte: 152ms
- Cocos2d download: 0.5-1.7s (varies)
- CDN location: United States

elsgame.cc (Cloudflare):
- DNS lookup: 2ms
- TCP connect: 139ms
- TLS handshake: 287ms
- Time to first byte: 461ms
- CDN: Global (Cloudflare)


4. COMPRESSION ANALYSIS
=======================

✅ GOOD: Gzip compression enabled
   - Cocos2d: 2 MB → 616 KB (70% reduction)
   - Overall compression ratio: 24-30%

❌ BAD: No browser caching for main page
   - Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store
   - Every visit requires full reload


5. BANGLADESH-SPECIFIC CONCERNS
================================

Expected Issues:
🔴 HIGH LATENCY (200-400ms typical Bangladesh to US)
   - Akamai CDN uses US nodes
   - Bangladesh users will experience 3-5x slower loading

🔴 BANDWIDTH LIMITATIONS
   - 616 KB Cocos2d file at 100 KB/s: ~19 seconds
   - At 500 KB/s: ~4 seconds
   - Many Bangladesh users have <1 Mbps connections

🔴 DNS RESOLUTION
   - May fail in regions with DNS filtering
   - No failover configured

🔴 MOBILE NETWORK PERFORMANCE
   - Android devices limited to 2 concurrent downloads
   - Sequential loading increases total time


6. SIMULATED PERFORMANCE
========================

Current Location (Fast connection):
- Total load time: 2-3 seconds
- Cocos2d: 0.5-1.7 seconds

Bangladesh (100 KB/s connection):
- Estimated total: 20-25 seconds
- Cocos2d alone: 19 seconds
- User experience: VERY POOR

Bangladesh (500 KB/s connection):
- Estimated total: 5-7 seconds
- Cocos2d: 4 seconds
- User experience: POOR

Bangladesh (1 Mbps+ connection):
- Estimated total: 8-12 seconds
- User experience: MARGINAL


7. CONCURRENT LOADING TEST
===========================

Parallel downloads of 4 resources: 0.75 seconds
Multiple sequential requests: 0.2-0.6 seconds each
No apparent rate limiting detected


8. RECOMMENDATIONS
==================

IMMEDIATE (Critical):
1. ✅ Fix 404 errors for game bundles
2. ✅ Deploy CDN nodes in Asia (Singapore, Mumbai)
3. ✅ Enable browser caching for static assets

HIGH PRIORITY:
4. Implement resource lazy loading
5. Add loading progress indicator
6. Compress Cocos2d further or split into chunks
7. Use service worker for offline caching
8. Add DNS failover/redundancy

MEDIUM PRIORITY:
9. Implement adaptive quality based on connection speed
10. Add preconnect hints for CDN domains
11. Use HTTP/3 for better performance
12. Optimize asset bundle sizes


9. TESTING SUMMARY
==================

✅ Page accessibility: PASS
✅ Resource compression: PASS
❌ Game bundle loading: FAIL (404)
⚠️  CDN geographic distribution: POOR
⚠️  Bangladesh performance: EXPECTED POOR
⚠️  Mobile optimization: MARGINAL
